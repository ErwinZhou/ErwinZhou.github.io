About me 👨‍💻
======
Hi, there 👋
I'm Yuchen Zhou, an undergraduate student in Information Security at [College of Cyber Science](https://encyber.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in Tianjin, China. 

I previously had internship experience in many job posisitions 💼, including [Chinasoft International](https://www.chinasofti.com/en/) and [Longshine Tlogy Croup Co., Ltd](https://en.longshine.com/). I'm currently a research intern at [Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRIST)](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Dr. Sicheng Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/schzhao). I am enthusiastic about designing and building advanced intelligence systems, which are practical enough to shape the world in a better way. My research interests include multimodal, LLM, federated learning, AI4Sci, etc.

I am eager to seek a stage with more possibilities to grow, to learn, and to contribute. And more importantly, a place where I can experience the diversity of people, culture, and ideas. **I just love hearing about different lives and different perspectives! Wild and free of the cage. 👐** That's why I am pursuing a master degree of Computer Science in top universities worldwide. **I wholeheartedly believe that this is the right track and life experience that I have been looking for the all the time.**

Moreover, I am someone who is passionate about life 🤹. I am a big fan of films, TV series and soccer sports. I am recently finished several chapters of a movie-script-like novel about mind-uploading, which is a promising techology that fascinates me a lot. When it comes to my passion for sport, it represents me both in the pitch and outside it. I used to build a intelligence system for data analys and management of Premier League clubs, which is a project that combines my interests in both CS and sports.The codes is available now on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ErwinZhou/DatabaseSystem2022). I have many other repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/ErwinZhou), including some of my course projects and research projects. That's all attributed to my deeply appreciation of the free and open-source community. I am keen to contribute to it.

Feel free to contact me through my [email](mailto:erwinzhou10@gmail.com). Or you can reach me in FIT building 4-307 at TsingHua University, Beijing, China. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, embracing a more diverse world.
