About me 👨‍💻
======
Hi, there 👋
I'm Yuchen Zhou (Erwin Chow), an graduate student at [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/), [College of Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. My current major is **Master of Science in Information Networking**, focusing on computer systems, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies - **Bachelor of Engineering in Information Security** at the [College of Cyber Science](https://encyber.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) in Tianjin, China. I have a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, especially for software development and machine learning. 

As for my professional experience, I previously had internship experience in many job positions 💼. For research, I once worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Dr. Sicheng Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/schzhao). I am enthusiastic about designing and building advanced intelligence systems, which are practical enough to shape the world in a better way. My research interests include multimodal, LLM, federated learning, AI4Sci, etc. I also worked as a Data Analyst Intern at [Chinasoft International](https://www.chinasofti.com/en/) and an Assistant of Operations and Maintenance Engineer at [Longshine Tlogy Croup Co., Ltd](https://en.longshine.com/). **I am eager to applying for 2026 summer internship opportunities in the United States**, especially for Software Development Engineer (SDE) and Machine Learning Engineer (MLE).

I am eager to seek a stage with more possibilities to grow, to learn, and to contribute. And more importantly, a place where I can experience the diversity of people, culture, and ideas. **I just love hearing about different lives and different perspectives! Wild and free of the cage. 👐** 

Moreover, I am someone who is passionate about life 🤹. I am a big fan of films, TV series, and soccer sports. I am recently finished several chapters of a [movie-script-like novel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XchgpGe91bVJ1FBVQjxBmedlkscwkeBAmE16nMZU2gQ/edit?usp=sharing) about mind-uploading, which is a promising techology that fascinates me a lot. When it comes to my passion for sport, it represents me both in the pitch and outside it. I used to build a intelligence system for data analys and management of Premier League clubs, which is a project that combines my interests in both CS and sports.The codes is available now on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ErwinZhou/DatabaseSystem2022). I have many other repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/ErwinZhou), including some of my course projects and research projects. That's all attributed to my deeply appreciation of the **free and open-source community**. I am keen to contribute to it. I am also the founder of the [NKU-FY](https://github.com/NKU-feiyue) organization, which aims to help more graduate applicants at Nankai University applying for graduate schools outside China. 

Feel free to contact me through my Andrew [email](mailto:yuchenz8@andrew.cmu.edu). Or you can reach me at CMU campus. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, embracing a more diverse world.
