## Academic Github Page
This is my academic github page. I fork from the original repository and modify it to fit my own needs. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

### About This Page
I am currently an IS student at Nankai University in Tianjin, China. And I hold dreams of a top-tier master degree of Computer Science in the U.S. and a stage with more possibilities. 

In order to keep track of my future study and research, I create this page to record my learning process and research results. I will update this page regularly and share my thoughts and ideas with you.
